<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is probably the simplest to use python script which allows you to extract all your clippings (highlights) from the 'My Clippings.txt' file. 

It automatically extracts the highlights, sorts and organizes them into individual files (one per book) and gives you nice looking '.txt' files which you can then use as you wish. The best part is, you can extract highlights not only from the books that you have purchased from Amazon but from all the documents that you have upload and highlighted on your kindle.

</p>

PS: I use these extracts to share my highlights with the world in my [digital library](https://www.notion.so/zainkhan/ab388ee65fb140ad967a5013a9768354?v=afc3169f9e9e49b59d2357bd1a46aa54). You can do the same or simply use them to review what resonated with you while you were reading those books. 


**Who is this for?**
- Readers who would want to browse through their highlights to review the crux of the books
- You!
